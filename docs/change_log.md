# Change Log — Blinkit Excel Dashboard

A running log of how I extended the tutorial into an individual project.

## v1.0.0 — Initial Rebuild
- Recreated workbook structure: `Sheet Design`, `DashBoard`, `BlinkIT Grocery Data`.
- Standardized categories (Item Fat Content, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type).
- Imputed missing `Item Weight` by median of `Item Type`.
- Added calculated columns: `Outlet Age`, `Sales per Kg`, `Visibility Bins`.
- Built new PivotTables and connected slicers.
- Redesigned KPI cards and chart formatting for consistency.
- Wrote comprehensive README with reproducible steps and QA notes.

## v1.1.0 — Enhancements (planned)
- Migrate cleaning steps into Power Query for reproducibility.
- Add scenario panel and export-to-PDF macro.
- Add screenshot gallery to `/img` with dashboard states.
